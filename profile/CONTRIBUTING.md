# How to contribute

We are really happy you're reading this and are willing to contribute to the project. All contributions are welcome, but to ensure some govornance, all changes must be submitted as Pull Requests and will only be adopted in the solution after a review. This is to both ensure that only features relevant to the solution and the industry is included and to ensure the stability of the solution. 

A good advice is also to ensure adoption in solution before starting a new feature - this can be done by engaging with the user group and ensure their support.

## Testing

Please be sure to have done thorough testing before submitting any changes. We don't have the resources to do a full test, so we rely heavely upon You, the developers, to ensure testing.

We also strongly encourage you to write (unit)tests a long side with the feature - this will both ensure an easier review and future stability of the solution.

## Submitting changes

Please send a Pull Request to the Reviewers, with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Thanks :)
